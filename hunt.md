# Revision 1

Theme: Pixels

## Items required

* 2x2s 
* Laptop
* iPhone w/ `The Program`
* Geographical map

## Intro
There's an ancient civ, all techy and shit
All their programs/AI is still infecting/living in today's stuff, because ancient tech is still active.

Old man asks you to do a quest: Find one the machines that is infecting everything.
He gives you first tool: the iphone, and the first clue.

### Concept
Ancient tech stuff?

## The 2x2s
Spells out something using alphabet shown in quest_alphabet
Each has 2 faces, perhaps back face specifies the connections

## The Cipher
Book/Movie 

## The Search
Use the subways
Have to actually go and check

Use `The Program` to verify

## The Program
Make app for old iPhone
Upon arriving at the correct locations, activates, reveals secret
1 degree ~ 69 miles.

### Possible Locations

* One world TC: 40.7127° N, 74.0134° W
* Central park somewhere: 40.7829° N, 73.9654° W
* Draw out shape on map.
* 3 points to triangulate final location.

## Misc. Ideas
Make iphone look cool somehow, for immersion

find codes to enable features of `The Program`. Not all are necessary.

The secrets are in SD/MicroSD cards, and a SD --> USB converter is a "tech" you receive from the old man

Program gives hint when getting close to card

Near **geographic** places

## Story R1

The 4 squares are such a contrived puzzle it introduces the issue of how they possibly came to exist

Old dude left clues? Probably most sensible. Test of worthiness I guess.

Old dude turns out to be bad guy? **HIS** master gave him the test? Old dude is actually an AI, his creator set it up. 

# Revision 2

## Story R2

You do wetwork. 

Evil scientist created (not actually evil, dats a lie)
There was an AI, like an organism, that escaped 
The government had a built-in killswitch 
barely survived

Your mission is to kill it

Plot-twist! It's a good AI who just wants cuddles
You have to save it! :D

It's creator is hidden. First you have to find him. (Pt 1.)
He doesn't know where the AI hid either
You meet its creator, who helped to save it originally

AI likes the "smell" of the program, have to get close

## Items

* iPhone
* Backpack
* Nerf gun? 
* Map / Writing utensils

### Program

Scientist adds the program to phone for you to find the AI

#### Location

Don't use actual lat/lon, make it cooler

Maybe just hot/cold and you have to find it

Searching for AI takes time to recharge (30 minutes or something), have to be smart about where to use.
Tells you distance. 

### Finding the scientist

Given a dossier. (hints that he's not evil)

He's in NY. (unknown why, government sent you here)

Puzzle only, have to report to handlers before confronting scientist. 

Dossier contains current profession, have to puzzle out where
